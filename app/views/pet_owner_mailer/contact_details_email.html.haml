    %h1 Great news! 
    %p= "#{@provider.first_name} has indicated they are available to look after #{@owner.pet_name} on #{@enquiry.date.to_formatted_s(:day_and_month)}!"
    %h2 What happens next
    %p= "Contact #{@provider.first_name} to work out any additional details you want to know. Make sure you are fully confident of leaving your pet in their care - see our guidelines below if you have not used PetHomeStay before!"

    %h2 Confirm the listing you want to use via PetHomeStay
    %p Once you have received a couple of responses, select the provider you want to use and accept via PetHomeStay. (A provider can cancel any indicated availability up to being confirmed, so donâ€™t leave it too long!)
    %p Once confirmed, both you and the provider are committed to the booking.
    %p Your entire pets profile details will be sent to the Provider, including emergency contact details. 
    %p Any cancellations after this stage will incur the providers cancellation policy, if any, and the likelihood of negative feedback from the community!
    %h2 If you have not user a provider before
    %ul
      %li Be prepared to go to see the PetHomeStay or service
      %li Be upfront and honest about the type of help you expect
      %li Ensure both you and the provider have read and understand our House Rules
      %li NEVER leave your pet with, or invite into your home, someone you do not trust!
      %li Ask as many questions as you like, and remember that you do not have to accept anything whilst contacting the service provider. The only way a booking is confirmed is via your PetHomeStay notification screen.

      Thanks and happy PetHomeStaying!
