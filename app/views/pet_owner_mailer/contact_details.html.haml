%p.article-content Once confirmed, both you and the provider are committed to the booking.
%p.article-content Your entire pets profile details will be sent to the Provider, including emergency contact details.
%p.article-content Any cancellations after this stage will incur the providers cancellation policy, if any, and the likelihood of negative feedback from the community!
