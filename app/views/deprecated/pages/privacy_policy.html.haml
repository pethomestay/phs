      Hi! If you are reading this then you must be concerned about your privacy. That’s ok, because we are very serious about this point. We don’t sell your info, spam you with junk mail, and include unsubscribe on every optional communication we send. Unfortunately, your dog can’t chew up your spam mail like the newspaper, so we try to keep it to a minimum.
    %p We have tried to make the below policy as plain as we can, but if you have any queries, then please feel free to get in touch with us.
    %p Thanks and Happy PetHomeStaying!
    %p The PetHomeStay Team

    %p When you create an account we will ask you to set up a PetHomeStay profile (as Owner or Host). The profile will generally contain your first name, last name, e-mail address, phone number, location, profile photo and pet details. These profiles will be made available publicly throughout the Site and other PetHomeStay users will see your first name, your profile photo, and general information about your location (for example, your suburb), as well as any feedback left by other users, your own pet experience and the type of Service you offer. We will display this high level information in your profile page, elsewhere on the Site, and potentially on third party sites (e.g., through the use of a HTML “widget” or API). We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.
