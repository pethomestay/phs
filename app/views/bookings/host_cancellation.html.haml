    Please select a Booking to Cancel:
    %br
    = form_tag '/bookings/host_cancel', :class => 'simple-form' do
      - booking_hash = {}
      - @bookings.each do |booking|
        - booking_hash["#{booking.booker.name}, Start Date: #{booking.check_in_date.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')}"] = booking.id

        PetHomeStay takes cancellations by Hosts very seriously, as it can cause great impact on Guests and reflects poorly on our community.
      %p
        Cancellations should be requested under Emergency situations only and are approved via a PetHomeStay Admin, who will endeavour to find a replacement Host if possible.
