  %em Last Updated: December 3rd 2012.
%p A quick note from the PetHomeStay team…
%p
  %em
    When using PetHomeStay,
    %strong PLEASE
    remember that we are simply an on-line sharing community providing a third party matching service (although a very cool and innovative one!) This is like an auction or a dating website or marketplace, we don’t have any control over the people, owners, hosts, services or pets who are listed, nor do we take any responsibility for their actions. We don’t vouch for them, screen them, or approve them in any way.
  %em
%p
  %em Ultimately, the best results arise from choosing an appropriate, reputable provider who is well rated by other users.  Use the trust inherent in the feedback system and our House Rules  (pethomestay.com/House-Rules) to select a provider who is right for you.  If you have any doubts, or concerns about a Provider, DO NOT use them.
%p
  %em
    The contract of services, including the responsibility of care, liability in case anything going wrong, or monies involved, is
    %strong strictly between the PetHomeStay Host, and the Pet Owner who agrees to utilise their services.
%p
  %em
    We have made significant effort to minimise the chances of things going wrong, but, as the extensive legal notes say below (blame our lawyer) in the event of an accident,
    %strong PetHomeStay takes no responsibility or liability for ANY incidents involving pet hosts, pet service providers, or pet owners!
%p
  %em
    Have fun, make some new four and two legged friends, but
    = succeed "," do
      %strong make sure you follow the House Rules
    %strong
      %span{:style => "text-decoration: underline;"} especially
    if it is a person or a pet that you don’t know.
%p
  %em Thanks PetHomeStayers, and love the animals you are fortunate enough to be around!

    %span{:style => "text-decoration: underline;"} Financial Terms
%p PetHomeStay provides a platform for Hosts to create listings for providing Services to Owners, which may include temporary pet boarding, pet daycare and related services in the comfort of the Providers’ private residences, at the Owner’s private residence, or at a third party location.
%p PetHomeStay does not charge any fees at present, but reserves the right to do so in the future.  This will be fully communicated on the Site to all Users in advance and, at our discretion, by regular mail or e-mail using the information contained in our database from User registrations.
%p Hosts may create listings, and will be required to provide detailed information about your place and pets (if relevant). You may set the pricing and terms for the Services you offer, within the parameters permitted by the Site.
%p Owners may request Services through the Site by responding to Providers’ listings.
%p Hosts may charge Owners fees, or make other arrangements, for providing Services.  PetHomeStay plays no role in any arrangements which may arise between Owners and Hosts in respect of provision of Services, and Owners and Hosts are solely responsible for such arrangements.  Save as otherwise agreed in writing between the Host and Owner, each Host must provide the Services, and each Owner must pay such fee, as specified on the Host’s profile at the time the booking is made.
%p Each Host may, but is not obliged to, include their own refund policy as part of their unique differentiation for their particular Service.  A Host is not obliged to refund any monies to an Owner, unless agreed in writing to the contrary between the Host and Owner. In addition, it is up to each Owner and Host to agree whether any fee charged for a service is payable before or after the Service is provided (for example, when the pet is dropped off to their house, or when it is picked up at the end), and in the absence of any agreement, any terms set out on the Host’s Profile prevail.
%p Each Host also acknowledges that Services it provides may be subject to certain statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law (including such State or Territory version as applicable in any jurisdiction in which such Services are provided).
%p Each Provider agrees, in order to create a fair and impartial record of PetHomeStay service provision, to use the PetHomeStay feedback system to place fair and impartial feedback after using Services, including, if an Owner, feedback on each Host and, if a Host, feedback on each Owner (and the Owner’s pet). Failure to do so may result in your registration or access to all or part of the Site being suspended or terminated.
%p  
%p Owners are also encouraged to add reviews of other Pet Services which they have used in the past.
%p
  %em
    %span{:style => "text-decoration: underline;"} For Medical Situations Involving an Owner’s pet:
  Each Owner acknowledges and agrees that, unless agreed in writing to the contrary between the Host and Owner, in the event any situation arises where host reasonably considers that the Owner’s pet requires veterinary care while in the care or custody of the Host, the Host may consult with the Host’s veterinary surgeon (or the surgeon nominated on the Owner’s Profile) and take all reasonable action as recommended by such vet. On presentation of suitable receipts, Owner must reimburse all costs incurred by the Host, subject to any limit nominated on the Owner’s Profile or otherwise agreed in writing between the Host and Owner.
%p The emergency information contained in the Owner’s Profile will be automatically sent to the Host on request of a Service.
%p If an Owner’s Profile refers to his/her own insurance and/or emergency procedures, those arrangements will take precedence (unless agreed in writing to the contrary between the Host and Owner).

A Host may also nominate its own cancellation policy, which will show up as a custom policy when an Owner searches for a listing. The Owner agrees to be bound by the cancellation nominated by the Host unless agreed otherwise in writing between the Host and Owner.
%p
  We advise as part of our House Rules (
  %a{:href => "http://www.pethomestay.com/house-rules"}> www.pethomestay.com/house-rules
  ), that a first-time booking between each Owner and Host, the Owner and Host should meet in person to introduce the Owner’s pet to the Host and the Host’s location and pets (if any). This should take place before the specified cancellation policy deadline, so that the booking can be cancelled if necessary.
%p
  %strong
    %span{:style => "text-decoration: underline;"} RISK MANAGEMENT & INSURANCE
%p Home pet boarding is not appropriate for all pets. Each User acknowledges that it is the Owner’s sole responsibility to determine if PetHomeStay Services are suitable for its pet and to select a suitable Host. While a Host’s User rating may include positive comments, PetHomeStay makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy of such comments nor the quality, security or positive features of the Host or the Host’s residence. PetHomeStay is not party to any agreement or transaction between each Owner and Host and, as such, cannot verify or otherwise authenticate any claims made by the Host or any aspect of the Host’s profile (including any medical certifications or insurance coverage held by the Provider).  When discussing and providing Services, each Owner and Host must make available to each other any and all relevant information, including medical issues, allergies or other conditions, about all relevant persons and animals that may be involved in the Services.
%p To the maximum extent permitted at law each User assumes, and PetHomeStay and its affiliates and Third Party Providers and their respective directors, officers or employees (collectively “PetHomeStay entities”) disclaim, all risk of any liability, loss or damage (including property damage, personal injury or death to any person or animal) which may arise in relation to the User’s use of the Site or the Services (whether arising in tort (including negligence), breach of contract, breach of statutory duty or otherwise).  This disclaimer of liability, loss and damage shall apply even if the PetHomeStay entity has been advised, or should have knowledge, of the possibility of such liability, loss or damage.
%p Subject to the following paragraph, except where expressly provided otherwise on the Site, all Content and Services are provided “as is” and each PetHomeStay entity disclaims all express or implied representations, warranties, guarantees, and conditions (“guarantees”) in relation to the Site and Services, including such guarantees of safety, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, quality of goods and services, reliability, availability, timeliness, quality, suitability and accuracy, and any guarantee related to the quality of goods and/or services of Third Party Service Providers and any persons or businesses referred to on the Site, including such guarantees as may be implied by law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each PetHomeStay entity disclaims any guarantee that the operation or use of the Site or provision of the Services will be timely, secure, uninterrupted or free of errors, viruses or harmful components.  Each User acknowledges that none of the PetHomeStay entities controls the transfer of data over communications facilities, including the internet, and that the Site and Services may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities and no PetHomeStay entity is responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or other damage resulting from such problems.
%p Nothing in the preceding paragraph will operate to exclude any guarantee that may not be lawfully excluded.  To the extent that a guarantee implied by law may not be lawfully excluded, but liability for breach thereof may lawfully be limited, the liability of each PetHomeStay entity for breach of each such warranty is limited to one or more of the following (at the discretion of the relevant PetHomeStay entity):
%p (i)         in the case of goods:
%p (A)     the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
%p (B)     the repair of the goods;
%p (C)     the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
%p (D)     the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired.
%p (ii)        in the case of services:
%p (A)     the supplying of the services again; or
%p (B)     the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
%p To the maximum extent permitted at law, each PetHomeStay entity disclaims all liability for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages which may arise in relation to the use of the Site or the Services (whether arising in tort (including negligence), breach of contract, breach of statutory duty or otherwise).
%p Each User assumes, on behalf of itself and all third parties (including minors) who may be exposed to any animal in connection with any use of the Site or the Services by it, all risk of liability, loss or damage (including property damage, personal injury or death to any person or animal) which may arise in relation to the use of the Site or the Services (whether arising in tort (including negligence), breach of contract, breach of statutory duty or otherwise).  Without limiting the foregoing, each User acknowledges the risks arising from boarding an animal that may not be accustomed to any persons (including minors) or property to whom such animal may be exposed.
%p Each User:
%p (i)            indemnifies and must keep indemnified each PetHomeStay entity against; and
%p (ii)           on its own behalf and on behalf of any and all third parties (including minors) who may be exposed to any animal in connection with any use of the Site or the Services, and all personal representatives, successors, heirs, and assigns of any of the foregoing, releases and discharges each PetHomeStay entity against from,
%p any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including lawyers’ fees and costs) in respect of any liability, loss or damage (including property damage, personal injury or death to any person or animal) which may arise in relation to the use of the Site or the Services by such User (whether arising in tort (including negligence), breach of contract, breach of statutory duty or otherwise).
