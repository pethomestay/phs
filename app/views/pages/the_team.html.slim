    | Tom and Bronwyn created PetHomeStay in September 2012, when they moved to
    |  Melbourne and couldnâ€™t find anyone local to look after their pet.
  p
    | They wanted a cheaper, and more convenient alternative to traditional
    |  kennels where their pets could stay with a loving family - and after
    |  speaking to many people at their local dog park found they needed a pet
    |  sitter as well!
  p
    | Tom is the day to day CEO and parent of Izzy Beagle. He is passionate on
    |  using his 15 years of cloud process experience to make pet care better
    |  for both people and their pets. Tom loves a good pet related chat, so
    |  feel free to get in touch with Tom.
  p
    | Bronwyn manages the PetHomeStay investor relations, governance and Board.
    |  Parent of Cooper Great Dane, she is a frequent business traveller and
    |  loves the idea of her dog staying with friendly people who understand the
    |  unique needs of her giant puppy. To chat to Bronwyn, get in touch with
    |  her.
