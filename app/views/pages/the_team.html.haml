  %p Tom & Bronwyn created PetHomeStay in September 2012, when they moved to Melbourne and couldn’t find anyone local to look after their pet.
  %p They wanted a cheaper, and more convenient alternative to traditional kennels where their pets could stay with a loving family - and after speaking to many people at their local dog park found they needed a pet sitter as well!
  %p Tom is the day to day CEO and parent of Izzy Beagle. He is passionate on using his 15 years of cloud process experience to make pet care better for both people and their pets. Tom loves a good pet related chat, so feel free to get in touch with Tom.
  %p Bronwyn manages the PetHomeStay investor relations, governance and Board. Parent of Cooper Great Dane, she is a frequent business traveller and loves the idea of her dog staying with friendly people who understand the unique needs of her giant puppy. To chat to Bronwyn, get in touch with her.
  %p PetHomeStay currently uses a mix of in-house and external contractors for technical development, marketing and operations.
