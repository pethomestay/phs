    Hi! If you are reading this then you must be concerned about your privacy. That’s ok, because we are very serious about this point. We don’t sell your info, spam you with junk mail, and include unsubscribe on every communication we send. Unfortunately, your dog can’t chew up your spam mail like the newspaper, so we keep it to a maximum of one newsletter a fortnight.
  %p We have tried to make the below policy as plain as we can, but if you have any queries, then please feel free to get in touch with us.
  %p Thanks and Happy PetHomeStaying!
  %p The PetHomeStay Team

We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by PetHomeStay users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser.

This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

    %strong Site Security
  %p Please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody.  We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent.  Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your Personal Information or data during its transfer via Internet.  Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.
  %p For network security purposes and to ensure that our Site remains available to all users, we employ commercial software programs to monitor network traffic and attempt to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

    %strong External Site Links
  %p PetHomeStay may link to Sites created and maintained by public and private organizations which may include or offer third party products or services.  When you access a linked site you may be disclosing private information. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.  These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.  PetHomeStay does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked Site and does not have responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. If you click a link to an outside website, you will leave the Site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website.  PetHomeStay cannot authorize the use of copyrighted materials contained in linked websites. Users must request such authorization from the sponsor of the linked website. PetHomeStay is not responsible for transmissions users receive from linked websites.

(See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)
  %p
    %strong Web Publishing
  %p When you register through the Site and create a profile webpage, other PetHomeStay users will see your first name, your profile photo, and general information about your location ( for example, your suburb), as well as any feedback left by other users, your own pet experience and the type of homestay or service you offer. We will display this high level information in your profile page, elsewhere on PetHomeStay, and potentially on third party sites (e.g., through the use of a  HTML “widget” or API). We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.
  %p If you post a PetHomeStay or PetService, we may publish that listing anywhere on the Site and may enable third parties to publish your listing on their site through the use of an HTML “widget”. We may also display the geographical location of your listing in the form of a map so that potential guests can see the general area and neighborhood of your listing, but your actual street address will not be disclosed until a booking is confirmed. If you enter into a confirmed booking with another PetHomeStay user (that is, you request hosting or sitting from another user, the other user confirms your reservation) you will have access to that user’s full contact information including specific address, and that user will have access to your contact information.
