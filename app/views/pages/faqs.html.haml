  %h3 PetHomeStay FAQs
  %h4 What is PetHomeStay?
  %p PetHomeStay offers an awesome new option to kennels or traditional house sitting in that you can board your pet at another person’s home or ‘HomeStay’.
  %p Pet Owners can search, message, and book a HomeStay close to them, meet up with Hosts, and leave feedback for the rest of the community about the specific PetHomeStay Host, and the Pet Owner is dealing with the Host directly.
  %p PetHomeStay allows the community to vet every interaction so you can be sure of getting someone reliable whom others know.
  %br
  %h4 How Does it Work?
  %p A Pet Owner searches via postcode for HomeStays near to them. They can Message the HomeStays that hit the right mix of price and quality of service, see who is available, and then Book a HomeStay.
  %p Payment is authorised at the time of booking, and as soon as a Host accepts the Booking,the Pet Owners card is charged.
  %p The Pet Owner then leaves their pet at the HomeStay, and the pet receives lots of cuddles and playtime!
  %p The Pet Owner picks up the pet at the end of the Stay, and have 48 hours to let us know if there is anything wrong.
  %p Assuming everything is ok, the Host fees will automatically be queued up and paid to them between 5-7 days after the Stay completes, minus the PetHomeStay Service & Insurance Fee.
  %br
  %h4 Do you provide In-Home Sitting?
  %p Yes – some of our Hosts will offer this capability. However, PetHomeStay does not check police certificates or provide any kind of approval to this, and does not recommend it until you are completely confident of the Host. A Pet Owner must check extremely carefully before allowing anyone they don’t know into their house. Only allow those people who you are sure are genuine, trusted pet sitters into your home, as you would with a babysitter or a similar trusted person. Make sure you follow our guidelines.
  %p We advise a Pet Owner only contacts professional pet sitters and registered businesses for this kind of service.
  %br
  %h4 Do you provide HomeStays for pets other than dogs?
  %p Yes – around 85% of our community is dogs at present, but we also have around 10% who will look after cats, and a mix of horse, bird and small animals.
  %p Please note that our Insurance only applies to Dogs & Cats.
  %br
  %h4 Are you trying to replace traditional kennels, catteries or daycare centres?
  %p
    No - we absolutely believe that some traditional kennels or catteries are
    %span.font-italic superb
    for your pet, and provide much needed socialisation, diet, exercise or even discipline time. Some of those facilities have staff who have undergone special training, including first aid, or have been certified by the SPCA or their respective industry associations. Some of them are like adventure holidays for pets!
  %p We think these organisations will always be needed, and we want our users to share their experiences so the best of them can be recognised for their efforts.
  %p However, just like in professional hotels, there is a huge range of standards between the good operators, and the not-so-good operators.
  %p If there are some poor operators out there, who keep their pets in cages all day, feed the cheapest pet food and have poor facilities, we want the community to tell people as well so that they can avoid them and only use the good ones!
  %br
  %h4 Can professional pet boarding services like kennels or catteries list alongside ordinary PetHomeStays?
  %p Yes - choosing the right PetHomeStay is up to the pet owner, so we are not trying to force you down a particular route. We would rather show you the range of PetHomeStays in your area, including the professional ones, along with their costs, and their feedback rating, and allow you to make the call as to which ones are right for your pet.
  %p Often the more professional HomeStays are quicker to respond and have more capacity (especially at peak holiday times) than individual people.
  %p All Messages and Bookings received via PetHomeStay must be transacted through the PetHomeStay system, for the first and all subsequent Bookings.
  %br
  %h4 How does PetHomeStay make any money?
  %p PetHomeStay has implemented a booking system inside the website, and collects all HomeStay fees on behalf of it’s Hosts. PetHomeStay then charges a Service Fee of 15%, plus Insurance of $2 per night. When a HomeStay is successfully completed, PetHomeStay then pays out the remainder to the nominated Host bank account.
  %br
  %h4 Who is behind PetHomeStay?
  %p PetHomeStay was started in August 2012 in Melbourne by Tom LeGrice and his partner, Bronwyn Dilley. From a small community based in their local dog park, Edinburgh Gardens, it has grown into the fastest growing peer-to-peer pet sitting community in Australia.

  %h3 Host FAQs
  %h4 I’ve just signed up as a PetHomeStay Host, what do I do now?
  %p
    Make sure you read the ‘House Rules’ well. Follow them carefully for
    %span.font-underline at least
    the first couple of times you board a pet in your home.
  %p Use the Twitter & Facebook links on your listing to let all your friends know you have a HomeStay and are keen to look after pets.
  %p Try to build your profile and trusted reputation by looking after your families and friends pets first. Most Hosts will know their first couple of potential pets from parks and your local neighbourhood.
  %p Ensure any Messages and Bookings are done completely via PetHomeStay via the system. It is the only record that we and our insurance company will accept in the event of any dispute.
  %p Respond promptly and politely to any queries or requests for availability.
  %br
  %h4 Who provides food?
  %p This is provided by the Pet Owners, as it is unwise to change petfood dramatically from one brand to another over short spaces of time. It also helps to avoid digestion/ mess issues.
  %p The Pet Owner needs to bring the food when they drop the pet off.
  %p Any other arrangements need to be discussed between the Host and the Pet Owner.

  %h3 Cancellation FAQs
  %h4 What happens if a Pet Owner has to cancel a Booking?
  %p
    The Pet Owner needs to contact PetHomeStay immediately via email to
    %span.font-bold
      = link_to 'support@pethomestay.com', 'mailto:info@support@pethomestay.com', html_options = { target: '_blank', title: 'Mail Us' }
    !
  %p We understand that sometimes unavoidable things happen, but when either a Host or a Pet Owner cancels at the last minute, it creates a real problem for the other party. As PetHomeStay has incurred fees in taking and holding the booking, we charge our Service Fee and Insurance fee before any cancellation fees are returned as below.
  %p For Pet Owner cancellations occurring:-
  %p 14 days or more in advance of Booking Start Date - 100% refund will apply.
  %p Between 13 days - 7 days in advance - 50% refund will apply.
  %p Less than 7 days - No refunds will be given.
  %p These are worked out as whole or partial calendar days from the start of the booking.
  %p Example
  %p
    A Booking is made to commence on 20th of a month. A Pet Owner sends an email to
    = link_to 'support@pethomestay.com', 'mailto:info@support@pethomestay.com', html_options = { target: '_blank', title: 'Mail Us' }
    indicating this on:-
  %p - 6th of that month or before. PetHomeStay will return all of the booking fee to the Pet Owner after fees.
  %p - 7th- 13th of that month. PetHomeStay will return 50% of the booking fee to the Pet Owner, and payout 50% to the Host after fees.
  %p - 14th of that month or later. PetHomeStay will pass on all of the booking fee to the Host, with no refund to the Pet Owner.
  %p Hosts cancelling after accepting a Booking is treated as extremely serious, and will be treated on a case by case basis, but could result in removal from the PetHomeStay community.
  %p We only take emails to support@pethomestay.com as evidence of a cancellation being requested, and will work out any refunds based on the timestamp we receive the email.

  %h3 Insurance FAQs
  %h4 What does PetHomeStay insurance cover?
  %p Our insurance covers Hosts against Public Liability and Errors & Omissions (such as accidental medication).
  %p Please see our Insurance page for a more detailed list of Exclusions and Policy Details.
  %br
  %h4 Does your insurance cover against pet accidents or vet bills?
  %p No – PetHomeStay does not have insurance covering pet accidents or vet bills.
  %p By using PetHomeStay, Pet Owners automatically authorise Hosts to seek professional medical treatment if necessary and authorises PetHomeStay to charge this to their credit cards.
  %p We have taken the stance that most Pet Owners would rather their pet received medical attention, however, if a Pet Owner DOES NOT want medical attention given to their pet, they MUST ensure their Emergency Contact is a) available, and b) has been informed of their wishes not to authorise treatment.
  %p Please see our Insurance page for more details and the full Exclusions list.
