  %p PetHomeStay is Australia’s fastest growing peer-to-peer pet care site. Our mission is to provide better quality pet care, from trusted local pet lovers.
  %p We believe that  people shouldn’t have to compromise between busy modern lifestyle and caring for a pet.
  %p Ultimately, we want to reverse the decline in pet ownership in Australia, by making it easier for everyone to experience the joy that a relationship with a pet brings.
  %p PetHomeStay is a ground-breaking new service in that we are the only service to offer full public liability to our Hosts & Pet Insurance to our Guests. In fact, we were the first peer-to-peer company in Australia to offer this kind of safety net, which has now been replicated across other peer-to-peer sectors such as handymen and bar staff.
  %p PetHomeStay is expanding rapidly across Australia and aims to become the standard choice for pet care.
  %p We are expecting to grow organically and through capital injection during 2014/15, and are always interested in hearing from new angel investors or venture capital firms who understand the potential value of PetHomeStay in Australia’s $8bn market (Animal Health Alliance, 2013).
