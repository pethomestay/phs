        | PetHomeStay feels strongly about helping pets in need.
        | Our founder Bronwyn is from Western Australia and we felt that bushfire 
        | affected pets and owners could use the PetHomeStay platform for good. 
        | Please note that Pet Accident & Emergency Insurance is not applicable on Bushfire Emergency stays.

      p
        | Bushfire Hosts get a special bushfire logo on their listing to show
        |  that they work for a cause.

      h4 Charity Hosts

      p
        | Many people feel incredibly passionate about pets and community - so
        |  PetHomeStay allows them raise money for charity by letting them do what
        |  they love!

      p
        | PetHomeStay is proud to support PetRescue, Australia’s leading animal
        |  adoption platform, by allowing people to nominate themselves as a Charity
        |  Host.

      p
        | Charity Hosts will get a special PetRescue logo on their listing to show
        |  that they are a fund raiser - they also get far more enquiries from
        |  potential Guests who want to support them!

      p
        | HomeStays start from just $10, and 100% of fees from their HomeStays go
        |  straight to charity - so just by looking after their next door
        |  neighbour’s pet, Hosts can earn money to help those animals in need.

      p
        | Every Host chooses when and how often they want to pet sit, so it is a
        |  great way to do something good thats fits in with any pet lovers
        |  lifestyle.

      p
        | We at PetHomeStay are incredibly passionate about this cause, so please
        |  consider becoming a PetHomeStay Charity Host!
