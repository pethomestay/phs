      span.section-title About this listing
      p I always grew up with dogs but since I left the homeland, I've not been able to get a dog of my own - so I'd be thrilled to look after yours! Sadly I'm not currently set up to have animals stay at my place, my housemate's territorial moggy put paid to that idea. But I am desperately missing canine companionship! I have years of experience with pets of all shapes and sizes, however I usually prefer to look after dogs and cats, and I have lots of experiance with larger dogs.
      p My working hours are reasonbly flexible and am able to work remotely should I need to. So I can provide plenty of walks, cuddles, games and attention to your furry pal, as well as looking after your house while you are away. All round piece of mind really!
      p Any questions feel free to ask, I can provide references from previous home stays and I'm even lucky enought to be the PetHomeStay's Mascots, Izzy and Cooper's number one dog sitter!
